*PhD candidate, LMU Munich*

I am a PhD candidate at the Bavarian AI Chair for Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence at LMU Munich under the supervision of [Prof. Gitta Kutyniok](https://www.ai.math.uni-muenchen.de/members/professor/kutyniok/index.html). Furthermore, I am an associated PhD at the [Konrad Zuse School of Excellence in Reliable AI (relAI)](https://zuseschoolrelai.de/people/scientists/christopher-bulte/) and the [Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)](https://mcml.ai/team/juniors/).

**My research interests:**
- Uncertainty quantification
- Probabilistic predictions
- Physics-informed machine learning

My research revolves around uncertainty quantification, probabilistic modeling, and its applications in the natural sciences. I have a strong interest in the theoretical foundations of such methods, as well as in their practical applications. Furthermore, I am interested in developing novel probabilistic or uncertainty quantification-related methods for neural networks. Applications of the developed methods include [meteorology](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/aies/aop/AIES-D-24-0049.1/AIES-D-24-0049.1.xml), [dynamical systems](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gangoPXSRw), [energy systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666546823000113) or quantum physics.


Before the start of my PhD I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and a Masters's degree in Mathematics from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
