*PhD candidate, LMU Munich*

I am a PhD candidate at the Bavarian AI Chair for Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence at LMU Munich under supervision of [Prof. Gitta Kutyniok](https://www.ai.math.uni-muenchen.de/members/professor/kutyniok/index.html).

My research revolves around applying methods of machine learning and uncertainty quantification to physical problems. I have a strong interest in utilizing neural networks for probabilistic predictions and its underlying theory. Furthermore, I am generally interested in developing novel uncertainty quantification methods for machine learning. Application of the methods include dynamical systems, meteorology or energy systems.

My research interests:
- Physical law learning
- Uncertainty quantification
- Probabilistic predictions

Before the start of my PhD I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and a Masters's degree in Mathematics from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

**If you have any questions about my research or want to collaborate feel free to contact me anytime**.
