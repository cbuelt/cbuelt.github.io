  abstract = {Recent methods in modeling spatial extreme events have focused on utilizing parametric max-stable processes and their underlying dependence structure. In this work, we provide a unified approach for analyzing spatial extremes with little available data by estimating the distribution of model parameters or the spatial dependence directly. By employing recent developments in generative neural networks we predict a full sample-based distribution, allowing for direct assessment of uncertainty regarding model parameters or other parameter dependent functionals. We validate our method by fitting several simulated max-stable processes, showing a high accuracy of the approach, regarding parameter estimation, as well as uncertainty quantification. Additional robustness checks highlight the generalization and extrapolation capabilities of the model, while an application to precipitation extremes across Western Germany demonstrates the usability of our approach in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract = {Multivariate time series with missing values are common in a wide range of applications, including energy data. Existing imputation methods often fail to focus on the temporal dynamics and the cross-dimensional correlation simultaneously. In this paper we propose a two-step method based on an attention model to impute missing values in multivariate energy time series. First, the underlying distribution of the missing values in the data is learned. This information is then further used to train an attention based imputation model. By learning the distribution prior to the imputation process, the model can respond flexibly to the specific characteristics of the underlying data. The developed model is applied to European energy data, obtained from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity. Using different evaluation metrics and benchmarks, the conducted experiments show that the proposed model is preferable to the benchmarks and is able to accurately impute missing values.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-driven weather forecasting models have experienced rapid progress over the last years. Recent studies, with models trained on reanalysis data, achieve impressive results and demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art physics-based numerical weather prediction models across a range of variables and evaluation metrics. Beyond improved predictions, the main advantages of data-driven weather models are their substantially lower computational costs and the faster generation of forecasts, once a model has been trained. However, most efforts in data-driven weather forecasting have been limited to deterministic, point-valued predictions, making it impossible to quantify forecast uncertainties, which is crucial in research and for optimal decision making in applications. Our overarching aim is to systematically study and compare uncertainty quantification methods to generate probabilistic weather forecasts from a state-of-the-art deterministic data-driven weather model, Pangu-Weather. Specifically, we compare approaches for quantifying forecast uncertainty based on generating ensemble forecasts via perturbations to the initial conditions, with the use of statistical and machine learning methods for post-hoc uncertainty quantification. In a case study on medium-range forecasts of selected weather variables over Europe, the probabilistic forecasts obtained by using the Pangu-Weather model in concert with uncertainty quantification methods show promising results and provide improvements over ensemble forecasts from the physics-based ensemble weather model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for lead times of up to 5 days.},
